# BLMM - Bayesian linear mixed model with multiple random effects

A Bayesian LMM with multiple random effects (denoted as BLMM). The
proposed model can capture the predictive effects from both common and
rare variants, and is robust against disease models. It can
simultaneously select isolated predictors with large effects and a group
of predictors with small-to-large effects.
